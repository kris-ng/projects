"Fuck I feel you - I had such bad anger when I was depressed . No it ’ s not right that you yell at him but don ’ t blame yourself and don ’ t blame him - It is a symptom of depression and he needs to be understanding of what puts you over the edge and you either need to work together or break up . I ’ m sorry you ’ re both dealing with this . Yes , my boyfriend is amazing and helps calm me down during my anxiety attacks and has just held me while I cried and sometimes I used to get mad at him and try to push him away and he was really great about it . I ’ m now way way better because I ’ ve finally found a medication that works for me ( which I feel so lucky cuz I ’ ve had horrible luck with medication in the past and went almost ten years without taking any ) I ’ ve had boyfriends in the past who were not supportive and / or were the * cause * of my depression . I ’ m not trying to say that you have to wait until you ’ re not depressed to date , but sometimes working on yourself and seeing how you feel without another influence in your life can be really helpful . It helped me a lot . #definitely don ’ t be afraid to tell people HOW you need help ! Your boyfriend may be clueless on how to properly help you - idk how young you guys are . What your financial situation is , or how long you have been together , but if you ’ re young and he wants to go out and be social and you ’ re unable to , he may be resentful . Or if he ’ s paying your bills while you lay in bed depressed I ’ m sure that ’ s really frustrating for him . It usually goes two ways , and you have to understand that you probably aren ’ t acting your best self . Not to say you should blame yourself or be angry at yourself - but that you do need to put in the extra work to make yourself a priority . Get therapy , find support groups , read articles online , start medication if that ’ s something you ’ re interested in ( don ’ t feel like you have to ) , try reading , yoga , walks , taking a bath , or working out . Some days when I was depressed the most I could do was just take a shower or brush my teeth and go back to bed . But the more you try to build a routine no matter how small or maybe even pointless , you ’ re still taking steps in the right direction . Tell him what you need , let him know that you ’ re needing space , needing him to hold you , needing him to play a video game with you , needing him to take you out on a date so you have a reason to get dressed up - literally give him things he can do to help you and ask what you can do in return ( like go on a hangout with him and his friends , go out bowling together , take a walk to the park , do a chore around the house for him ) and see if any of that helps you both soften up a bit and see that the other is trying . Idk I know I just rambled a lot but I feel for you because I have been there .",NEUTRAL,Negative,joy
My wife is amazing and understanding and has helped me through many hard times . She's my rock . There are supportive and good partners in the world OP,POSITIVE,Positive,love
"I would say my husband is , but his view point on the support he gives is from his very limited understanding of what depression is . It's like that popular tiktok sound "" Raining ? Why is it still raining ? I did everything I was supposed to . "" Well unfortunately it feels like that rain will never go away . I've tried explaining it to him , but in the end I just let him do what he does best . Men like to fix things so if it looks like I'm happy with what he is doing , he keeps doing it . I see that as supportive enough . It does make me happy even if this heavy cloud never leaves .",POSITIVE,Negative,joy

"hey i ’ m 16 and a junior too , we have a rly similar story .

"It sounds like your cynical views on the world is causing some of your problems . And this is normal , loneliness and anxiety can make people a lot more defensive and on-guard . This could lead to people making bad assumptions about people that end up controlling future interactions . My advice is to do a lot of self-reflection on your views to see if their is more nuance to them that you did not initially recognize . And if there is , then keep that in mind in your next interaction with someone . Another thing that you could do is try to think more positively . And since it ’ s pretty hard to just “ be more positive , ” I recommend that you try to incentivize yourself into doing it . An example of this is to write down 5 things that you are grateful for .",NEUTRAL,Positive,anger

You need to keep finding the positive in everything , even if it is just a little thing . You have talents ; I wish I had the ability to make films ! So they didn ’ t win any prizes , but that doesn ’ t mean they aren ’ t successful . I am an artist , and one of the most profound things I have ever heard is that the problem with art ( and singing , and dancing ) is that the world has changed the definition of how to be successful at it . Art is meant to be an expression of yourself , a way to find something inside of you and bring it out ; film making is no different . If you are expressing yourself , you are already successful at it . You just need to keep doing it if it brings you joy . The money will come . It took me 40 + years to get to the place where doing what I love could help me make a living , but just last month I started a job teaching art at a paint studio .

"It sounds like you are looking for meaning in other people / your relationship with others . What you should focus on , is finding meaning in yourself . Going out into nature helps I find . What do you enjoy ? What interests you ? If you know , hone in on those things , they are uniquely yours in how you feel about them . If you dont know , maybe take some time to explore , or try to remember a time when you did enjoy stuff . What sort of things did you like at that time ? Try to remember what that felt like and why you held that interest . Its important not to go in expecting a lot , but even something small can help distract you . To compliment that , you could try giving your time to other people . Maybe if you can't find worth in yourself or life , you can find it in others . I dont mean you should look to other people's happiness and chase that for yourself , nono . What j mean is , if you like animals you could volunteer at a shelter , you could help serve food to homeless people or do whatever you think is worthy of time . Stuff like that might help . Life sucks and its fucking hard but its incorrect to say it has no meaning . I dont know what that meaning is , and im sad as shit myself but some part of me hasn't given up even though I end up on suicide hotlines . In my opinion , the best thing in the world is a hug , like a proper one - from an animal , friend or family member and its 10x better when you're drunk ( not suggesting you drink away your pains lol ) . I dunno if this has made any sense or helped you at all but like ? ? ? Life doesn't have some super grand meaning , we aren't here for any grand purpose - you find a thing that works for you and either take it or leave it , move on or hold on . Up to you ? Just finding a space where you can vibe is enough . Honestly i want to become a high school teacher to help kids like you , to maybe make life a little easier cuz im fucked up too and maybe some goddam empathy would help . Im sending you a virtual hug , no need to be strong or search for meaning just vibe and maybe extend a hand to help others .",NEUTRAL,Positive,joy

"Therapy and antidepressants , my friend . Not necessarily forever - but just to get you through for a bit . Basically until you have more intrinsic motivation and dont necessarily need them anymore . ( Unless you have clinical depression , in which case , perhaps stay on them ! ) Look into therapy , but not just talk therapy , but CBT / DBT would be appropriate for the feels you're describing . You can find free resources online if you want to get a taste for what those are about . Also , where talk therapy is concerned , a bit of advice ( based on a decade of personal experiences as well as convos with people ) which will hopefully help should you decide to go this route : So a ton of people give up on talk therapy within the first year , saying "" it didnt help . All we did was talk . It didnt help . Nothing changed . I didnt feel better . "" Which seems to be a typical experience so far as first time therapy experiences ... To avoid this - to get the MOST out of a talk therapy session - try NOT to spend the session talking about what OTHER people are doing that is upsetting you . What i mean by this is - if you are worried about a friend or a romantic partner or a parent or your coworkers ... it doesnt help you to go into a session saying "" my relationship.with so and so is stressing me out "" and then spend the next hour describing how they feel , what they do or dont do , what your concerns are about them and eventually circle back to the fact you're upset and then the session be over . Instead , focus on you . Your patterns , your behaviors , your character defects , your emotional responses and what makes you tick . What things trigger your various shades of depression to darken or lighten . Etc Try to learn the most about yourself that you can - keep other people's involvement to a minimum . Be selfish and self-absorbed , if only for that hour . Your therapist will be able to do much more for you if you enter with that mentality .",NEUTRAL,Negative,anger

"posted by : u / tDCS-NSSI-Research Treating Self-Injury through Research Study Thank you to the moderators of r / depressed for allowing me to post here ! I am part of a team of researchers at New York State Psychiatric Institute / Columbia University who are currently recruiting participants for a research study looking at an investigational treatment for self-injury called transcranial direct current stimulation , or tDCS . tDCS is a non-invasive , well-tolerated form of brain stimulation that delivers a low current to a specific area of the brain using electrodes . Research has shown that tDCS can help reduce negative emotions and may help treat depression and other conditions . We are seeking individuals between the ages of 18-65 who self-injure ( through burning , cutting , or other means ) . Eligible participants should be staying / living within 60 minutes travel distance of Manhattan ( New York , NY , USA ) to participate . The study involves completing a baseline psychological assessment , questionnaires and six sessions of tDCS during three visits over one week . This is a double-blind trial , so you may be randomly assigned to receive an active or an inactive form of tDCS . All research procedures can be done from your own home – no in-person visits are required . Three months of treatment visits with a psychiatrist for medication management will then be offered after AT NO COST to you . Compensation of $ 150 is provided for time and effort if you are eligible and complete all research procedures . The researchers on this team have no conflicts of interest to declare . All study procedures have been approved by the Institutional Review Board for New York State Psychiatric Institute . Some details about confidentiality and the use of your personal information : If you consent to participate in this research , your personal information will be kept confidential and will not be released without your written permission except as described in this section or as required by law . Your name or other identifying information will not be made known if the results of this study are published for scientific purposes . To make your personal research results not identifiable with you if they are used for publication in the scientific literature and presentation at scientific meetings , we will remove all your identifying information , including name and date of birth . Questionnaire answers and data collected during the task may be used in future studies , and if shared with other investigators , information that identifies the scan , questionnaire responses , or task data with you will be removed beforehand . There is a potential risk of loss of confidentiality from such data sharing , but this is extremely low as only de-identified data from this study may be shared . Clinical records , including your name and other personal identifying information , and research data will be kept in secure storage at the New York State Psychiatric Institute . Information in paper format will be kept in locked files . Electronic data will be protected by a firewall ( programming that makes it virtually impossible to access the data from outside the New York State Psychiatric Institute ) and by restricting access within the New York State Psychiatric Institute through use of a password known only to authorized personnel . If information is transmitted electronically , it will be encrypted so that your identifying information remains confidential Records will be available to research staff , and to Federal , State , and Institutional regulatory personnel ( who may review records as part of routine audits ) .

"Thanks for the reply lol , and by the way your talking i think we are from the same place since my grades also got shafted due to marks distribution for covid . And yes i suppose my brother was abused in his childhood and he is doing the same thing to my parents since they are the ones who did the abusing at least in his head . So he doesn't feel wrong to let his anger off on them and treat them like shit . And the thing is i wouldnt have been worried that much if i thought it was just a phase since everyone more or less goes through a phase like this in their life where all is lost and you dont know what to do with yourself . But my brother isnt dumb he knows exactly whats going on because before this he used to study a shit ton of phycology and watch motivational videos . So he is doing this knowingly and intentionally trying to trigger people . And since everyone is being considerate and giving him space or letting him do what he pleases hes doing it more and its kind of turning like a lifestyle for him . For example : i told him a few months back to not wear one of my shirts as it is my only shirt to go outside and none of the other shirts fit me , he purposely knowing that wore my shirt for a whole month straight . And he always takes my drinking bottle and puts his whole mouth on while knowing it bothers me , and i have told this soo many times but he never listens . But if i do something which he doesnt like , he will take up his fists . Thats just one of the millions of thing that add up together to make me hate him and i mean i want to kill him sometimes , we had fights before where he beat me quite bad but i never fought back since even while fighting i didnt want to hurt him and my mom said to not hit him . But he really tried to injure me . Now im scared that if he raises his hand at me one more time i will try to kill him and im scared that i wont be able to stop myself ( No Bs ) . So i think its best for me to move out atleast till the situation stabalizes . Otherwise in the next few years or so i have to be self sufficient to live on my own . But i dont really think my father nor my mother can deal with him at this point and they are just getting depressed with him . And at some point they will also start acting the same as my brother .

It wasn ’ t until I had a mental breakdown and ended up in the hospital when I realized it indeed was not normal to not want to exist and that ya girl had depression lmao . Thank you for the hair sympathy . Thankfully it isn ’ t too bad and according to my derm , It ’ ll grow back with treatment in about 6 months .

If it doesn ’ t grow back in 6 months I ’ m telling the doctor to fight me lmao . Thank you for taking the time to speak to me . It means a lot and made me feel better knowing I ’ m not alone in this feeling .

"I really don't know . Posts like this are one of the biggest reasons for why I feel that depression really is , or at least can be , a chemical balance in the brain . At least from the surface , you have all you want , or at least the girl of your dreams , and yet you are still depressed . I would suggest a few things that could help , though . 2 ) Gratitude and keeping a gratitude journal - this is a highly advisable activity that I hope you engage in and that you take this advice to heart . It has been scientifically documented that keeping a gratitude journal over the course of several weeks to months , writing in it periodically ( maybe 1 - 3 times per week , at least 5 things each time ) and - and this is key - feeling the gratitude and appreciation for the things you write and list down in it in your heart , well this has been scientifically proven through documented research that it can and does improve and increase a persons baseline level of happiness ( the average level of happiness from which a person feels on any given occasion , which is basically how happy or sad a person feels when nothing significant as happened to lessen or improve their happiness or their life , the average mood and emotional frequency in which a person inhabits . ) - well , it has been proven that keeping a gratitude journal over a period described above can and is able to raise a persons baseline level of happiness by up to 25 % ( or even higher , probably , too . ) . So , therefore , by acting grateful through writing out 5 good things you have in your life on paper or that you have going for you in a journal for gratitude , you can , over time , raise and improve your mood and quality of life possibly to a significant degree and level ! 2 ) Exercise - weight lifting , but and especially , walking and / or running outdoors - exercise has been a time tested and verified mood improver and cognitive enhancer . Often times , when we exercise , we are able to tap into our God given neural pharmacy of sorts , so to speak - our brains release endorphins which raise and lift our moods and our spirits , usually ( depending on the workout or exercise ) for several hours afterwards . If depression is a chemical imbalance , AND IF your anti-depressants have not worked as desired - - YET - - then , maybe you could make yourself happier , chemically speaking , via a daily workout and exercise regime . ALSO , walking and / or exercising in some form outdoors , especially and specifically during the daylight , is another proven way to affect your mood in a positive way as exposure of oneself to daylight is crucial to a persons mental wellbeing and sense of happiness and contentment in life as well . 3 ) Spirituality - whatever God you may or may not believe in ( personally I'm a Christian ) could be a very positive addition to your life if you choose to cultivate a deeper understanding of who God may be as well as what He encompasses , meaning , what that truth of His existence would mean for you and the way you have been designed and are meant to live life according to Him . What I can start you off with is that God is love and through love you can find a sense of connectedness and in doing loving acts and cherishing what you have as well as cultivating more love within you , your heart and soul , you can thus become more spiritual with or without any God involved ( though I'd certainly advise you to begin to research the various spiritual paths up until you find a pathway that seems the most logical to be a reflection of the nature of God ( I guarantee you that there is more to God than any 1 religion or religious text can even begin to describe or allow you to know , however , so much of what you or me or anybody knows about God who is a true beliver often comes down to what we are given as a portion from Him for our faith , meaning , what we can learn about God through our various life experiences and lessons which He uses for good in our lives to teach us and so we grow and mature as spiritual beings ) . 4 ) Meditation - As with an approach and effort towards spirituality , meditation and mindfulness is another crucial component and key step towards a mentally happier and healthier wellbeing and life . You could look it up and you will find countless articles and studies which show the positive impact and benefits / effects of a DAILY ( It MUST be DAILY for the benefits to be of any lasting or significant value , though initially you may likely still feel the relaxation of course because of its nature of peacefulness and calmness ) - of a DAILY meditation regime ( a 20 minute session each day is all you need by the way ) including ( but not limited to ) an increase in grey matter in the brain and a growth within a meditator's amygdala ( the portion of the brain which regulates hormones and counteracts anxiety and stress from what I can recall ) so there are real , physical changes which come about with meditation upon which you can be changed mentally and emotionally for the better , as well as other happiness inducing benefits which naturally arise and come from a meditative and mindfulness based way of life - look it up , there are many significant positive effects of this daily activity and habit you could and should take up . 5 ) Begin to read self-help books and watch self-improvement based videos on YouTube - - meaning , take up self-development - this could change your life in so many ways it's ridiculous ( providing you begin applying the material you are reading and / or watching ) trust me on this , I would explain ( and could if you ask me to ) but I am getting tired of writing atm ahaha . 6 ) Go to talk therapy / Begin to see a counselor or a therapist in person preferably , although if that is too expensive go to better help I think it's called or find another good therapy sight which you could afford ( or try out 7 - cups - - [ https://www.7cups.com/ ] ( https://www.7cups.com/ ) ) as it is basically a website of FREE THERAPY - My best former friend who died by a suicide 2 years ago first told me about this and I'm amazed at how cool and good o fa site it is and I actually just remembered it a bit ago while writing this and am looking forward to using it again soon today lol ) . 7 ) Maintain and / or keep a close relationship / cultivate a closer relationship with your family and / or loved ones . This is again a very good idea for greater mental and emotional wellbeing and happiness as this is one area of life that truly matters and actually , in my opinion , counts the most at creating the greatest meaning in and to a life which a person is alive to have and to actually live , too .",NEUTRAL,Negative,joy

Its shallow and looked down upon . But , right now , those are my things worth living for . It might be selfish but its my reason and Im going to hold onto it until it doesnt make me happy anymore .

"It's like slow suicide isn't it . 2020 I had two very deliberate attempts , I saw what they did to my family , hoe much distress it caused . Last year I just ate and drank silly amounts of stuff , like I'd sit and eat a full pack of parmesan cheese or huge bars of chocolate - knowing it wasn't good for me , knowing that at my age it could easily put me into heart attack zone ... it would look like a heart attack when in fact I'd sabotaged my health so badly it was a slow suicide . I also danced way to close to fatal doses of codeine etc but it would have appeared as an accidental overdose ... I'm all aches and pains and discomfort because of that now , because of the amount of codeine I've taken , because of all the shit I've put in my body . I've a wife and kids , the three eldest are adult enough to know I've struggled and thar it's not them , it's me , but I can't put that on my 6 year old ... I can not have her have such a horrible thing happen and then qs she gets older realise what I've done . I'm left so damaged by the fact that my blood family , my parents and sister just treat me as something to toy with , tried to manipulate my emotions etc , took chances on my mental health and security and exploited my vulnerabilities . I'm not sure why my parents , moreso my mother , would do that ? Whats important for me is that the kids know that it's not them causing the issues , it's my childhood and emotional abuse from people I'm supposed to have trusted , causing me the issues . I've been left to deal with the fallout from my mothers mental health issues , that she refuses to recognise , but I've recognised mine and I'm determined to not have the next generation to handle mine . My 6 year old especially doesn't deserve to have her life ripped apart like that , so I'm working hard to undo all the damage I've done to myself and change the environment around me to make it easier to have headspace I live in such a cluttered , overcrowded house that my mind will never be tidy until the house is , so that's one of the big things this year . I've identified all my triggers now I think , whereas I wasn't able to through the fog of medication etc , so now I'm free of all thar it's time to work on each trigger and change it .

"Agreed , I'm a hygiene freak , normally shower everyday , brush teeth , keep beard shaped etc etc . Last few years haven't been easy and I can defo identify with the personal hygiene thing .

I have a set upstairs and a set downstairs Likewise I moved my toothbrush downstairs and always have a bottle of mouthwash nearby ... I've always hated my toothbrush being in the bathroom anyway but I moved it downstairs as I'm more likely to use it .

My father and brother hate each other too and barely talk to each other now cuz of similar things that happened between your brother and father . But they live in the same house . I am glad my brother compromised and doesnt come out of his room when he comes home . Poor mother of yours . Hate how mothers are also always dragged into all of this . I feel sorry for you . Feels like you and me are alike and might be from the same place too . My result was bad this year too due to stupid covid marks distribution . Your brother is 27 and acts the same way as my brother . Took me a while to realize that . He was abused right ? Now hes abusing others with his toxic behaviour . This should not be accepted . He needs to fight it . Think about it . He was abused and its wrong . Now he is the abuser so why is it not wrong ? This cycles gonna continue if he keeps behaving like this and yall will be at fault too if you keep accepting it . Wrong is wrong and theres no excuse for it . I suggest trying to get him to therapy . You are the younger child . I feel bad for your brother but he cant do what hes doing . Therapy is the best for him . The truth is no one can help him except himself . You can try and provide assistance and care but thats all . If hes stubborn and doesnt wanna get better then leave him . Keep checking up on him and show care but theres nothing else you can do . You cant waste your life on him cuz theres no guarantee that hes gonna actually try . You are not required to set yourself on fire to keep other people warm . Its your life . Dont waste it . Move to a college campus and do whats best for you cuz staying isnt gonna do much and its not your responsibility to deal with all of them . You dont need to be so selfless . You dont wanna end up like your brother . Knowing your father , hes reaping what he unfortunately sow . I am again really sorry and you dont need to feel bad for doing whats best for you . Btw your post is very long thats why theres not many people replying . Try making a shorter one if you still want advice . Goodluck !",NEUTRAL,Negative,sadness

"Most people who act abusive have been abused earlier in life . Different people react differently to abuse . But theres one thing that took me a lot of time to learn and you should know too . Wrong is wrong and theres no excuse for it . The guy sounds like he didnt love you . He was obsessed with you instead . If a person says no , it means no and anyone who tries further , without the other person showing any signs of attraction , hes the one whos at fault . As much as suicide sounds bad , its not your fault at all . The guy couldn't handle things well that he had ruined with his own hands . You are a human and you have some rights which he violated . I am so sorry . As much as it breaks my heart reading all of this , I am glad you are still here with us and that you made it through . I am sorry about the people who did nothing . But you are not at fault . The guy sounds like a narcissist and he hurt you . I advice you see a therapist cuz all of this sounds horrible and he might be able to help you cope with it . And no , if you were not able to protect yourself , then its understandable too . Most people freeze when situations like these happen . I hope this year is the best one yet for you :purple_heart:",NEUTRAL,Positive,sadness
"Hey man , I ’ m in a similar situation where I have a friend where she and I used to talk for long periods of time and then out of the blue they just starting appearing and disappearing of the radar . And long story short it ’ s just so infuriating to know they didn ’ t value the friendship as much as I did . Plus with shit at home and just constant rumination about life , it just doubles the depression . Honestly I can ’ t feel shit because my happy persona it feels like I left it with them . I don ’ t have any life changing advice but I understand where you ’ re coming from and how important it is for you to vent right now . All I can say is take one things at a time , and you deserve the mental head space from that chick and from your household . All I do is watch anime and listen to ghibli music while in the household and honestly those quiet moments are probably the only happy parts of my day and keep me slightly motivated . But yeah man , if I were in your situation I would never contact that girl again and to the best of my ability walk away / be silent around your folks until you can get out again .

I wish I was a kid forever , because if he saw where I am now , he would have been so sad and disappointed . But unfortunately we can't change the past .

"Alright , I have never said this to anyone before because it's hard to say to someone knowing they won't understand but since I've seen something close to it now I'll say it ! Around the end of my Sophomore year in High School I stopped taking care of myself in all aspects . This went on for the rest of my years in High School . I would literally spend an entire week without brushing my teeth or properly cleaning myself . My hygiene was terrible . Junior year I just completely gave up and let myself go . I went from being muscular to 60 pounds overweight . Couldn't even cut wait to join the Air Force . I'm now almost 22 and I have been trying hard to try to correct my life and I can't stay consistent with it at all . My teeth have got to be infested with cavities by now . Probably would take over 10K to fix all of my dental issues . I can't stand how disgusting I've let myself get but yet I can't seem to fix it .

Maybe lockdowns stopped me from being distracted enough to get to how I really feel ... But it's energy zapping . I don't brush my teeth for days , don't shower for a week at a time ...

Your physical injuries will heal with time assuming you don't have a condition preventing you from so . Until then focus on your daughter . When you are feeling better it's time to get out there and put your life back on track stability-wise . When the moment is right to start looking for another woman you will know ... or maybe they'll find you before then ! Just don't force it or you will only attract those seeking a quick fling .

It takes practice , but it feels soo good to have peaceful , blissful feelings inside that no one can take away from us .

No matter what , I hope you stay happy and realize that happiness comes from the * * inside * * ; and * * no one can take that away * * . Think of any deity like prince shri krishna , or whoever else you like . They are so divine and calm .

"Shit you are having a rough time . It sounds fucking crushing , especially your stepdads death and the anniversary of your dads . Sometimes life is fucking cruel . I hope you get tooth fixed and manage to sort your debts , it ’ s crap having that shit to attend to . Hope things start to look up for you bud",NEUTRAL,Negative,sadness

"Thanks for your kind words , but honestly i really can't see myself enjoying being an adult , perhaps tolerating it for my family at most , but i just don't know why somebody would enjoy their "" freedom "" to drink and smoke even though they barely have time for their hobbies anymore , regardless , i really hope you're right , it's scary but it'll happen eventually , even if i don't want it to , hopefully i can get through it and not succumb to these thoughts , once again thank you and have a good night !",POSITIVE,Negative,joy
"Most of what you said is the standard for everyone . Twenty years ago I was just like you , unable imagine growing older and being a proper adult . I always had this idea that I would just die young for whatever reason . But it didn ’ t work out like that . Getting older is actually pretty cool and as you get older and you lose people you start to realise your lucky to be here , because those people you lost are gone forever . I do like your idea of reincarnation , a lot of people in my family believe that . But don ’ t kill yourself just to be reincarnated , you might actually enjoy becoming an adult .",NEUTRAL,Positive,joy
