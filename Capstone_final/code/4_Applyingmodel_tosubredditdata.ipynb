Most people think that it is our emotions that control our actions , but that ’ s not the whole truth . It ’ s a cycle . Our emotions effect our actions and our actions effect our emotions . Smiling makes people feel happy . Performing acts of love makes you feel love . Serving others makes you care about them . The the other side of that is darker .

I've tried explaining it to him , but in the end I just let him do what he does best . Men like to fix things so if it looks like I'm happy with what he is doing , he keeps doing it .

See the issue with “ that special person will come along someday ” is that it ’ s not a guaranteed thing . People tell me “ be patient , it will happen ” but I won ’ t really be happy if “ it will happen ” when I ’ m 50 and about to have sex with a hooker cos I never had any success in the dating game , or when I ’ m 70 and finally achieving some minimal success in my career field . I want to experience life while I ’ m still young but the way the cards were dealt , I ’ m just wasting away . However I appreciate the support and I ’ m glad you reached out .

I can ’ t say I have been through what you are going through . You are unique , we all are . However , I can say that I have struggled with depression and had similar thoughts to what you are expressing . Depression is a daily battle against an emotion . You have to fight . The cool thing is that we have the tools to fight . Of course there is medicine and counseling , but there is also things that you can do now that will help . Most people think that it is our emotions that control our actions , but that ’ s not the whole truth . It ’ s a cycle . Our emotions effect our actions and our actions effect our emotions . Smiling makes people feel happy . Performing acts of love makes you feel love . Serving others makes you care about them . The the other side of that is darker . Letting yourself wallow makes you more depressed . Positive actions make positive emotions and we can use that to rewrite our brain . Do this consistently and you can recover . It ’ s not always easy , but you can do it . You are loved . I love you .       POSITIVE              Positive      joy                 7\n",

It's literal human nature . We are not bears . We are not snakes . We are homo-sapiens that have lived for thousands of years ... together with each other . In a community . This generation of Americans is the first lonely generation , taught that we're supposed to be individuals rather than ... humans . The secret to happiness will always be a community you feel loved and accepted in . Sadly , though , our ancestors come from a long line of unhealthy communities . We destroyed some of the most healthy and loving human communities one could ever find in order to build the Americas into what they are today . All our ancestors are terrible , bad people who have no idea what it really takes to be happy . It's people . So don't feel bad that you need another human in order to survive . We literally all do . Just be glad you found that someone . Keep finding more . The most common thing found amongst those who live long lives , show that friendships are what kept them going the most .

And long story short it ’ s just so infuriating to know they didn ’ t value the friendship as much as I did . Plus with shit at home and just constant rumination about life , it just doubles the depression . Honestly I can ’ t feel shit because my happy persona it feels like I left it with them . I don ’ t have any life changing advice but I understand where you ’ re coming from and how important it is for you to vent right now . All I can say is take one things at a time , and you deserve the mental head space from that chick and from your household . All I do is watch anime and listen to ghibli music while in the household and honestly those quiet moments are probably the only happy parts of my day and keep me slightly motivated . But yeah man , if I were in your situation I would never contact that girl again and to the best of my ability walk away / be silent around your folks until you can get out again . I think there ’ s a lot of power in walking away than just going through the motions . Have a good 2022 .        NEUTRAL              Negative      joy                 7\n",

Like you said as long as you remain depressed and in a sticky situation your chance of attracting a proper woman is close to zero but you shouldn't necessarily feel broken because of this ; It's a chance for you to figure yourself out better and focus on things that make you happy . Enjoy the time you got with your daughter ... more so now that she needs someone to fill the void left and there's no better person to fill that void than a father . Your physical injuries will heal with time assuming you don't have a condition preventing you from so . Until then focus on your daughter . When you are feeling better it's time to get out there and put your life back on track stability-wise . When the moment is right to start looking for another woman you will know ... or maybe they'll find you before then ! Just don't force it or you will only attract those seeking a quick fling . And please try to make sure that your daughter knows of your adventures and is fully supportive of you getting on with another woman as it could cause a divide between you two . Stay strong , there's hope for you still .       POSITIVE              Positive  sadness                 7\n",

Its a very lonely and sad place . Find things , like a fuzzy blanket , a song you wouldn't normally listen to thats happy and upbeat . Music goes a long way . You can feel happy too .

This morning , the neighbors ' kitty went to say hi at the window and it gave me a smile . I also noticed I'm sensitive to the weather , so I try to enjoy the sun when it's there . I'm sorry you're depressed . My opinion is that while we're here , we can try to have some fun . Some day it will be over , and I don't believe in a second playthrough or any afterlife , so let's just make the best out of the options we have now . I think not being depressed doesn't mean being happy all the time , but it's just not overthinking about the bad stuff . And I know it's not something we really have control over . But there's hope , it can get better Smile        NEUTRAL              Positive  sadness                 7\n",

Days , weeks they don ’ t don ’ t mean a thing because how quickly they pass . I ’ m just alive for the sake of living , hoping for the sake of hoping , and being alive for no reason . I ’ ve always been hopeful but why ? What does hope bring ? Nothing but misery and disappointment . What I ’ m going to do is face death , psychologically . With dmt .

       "429  I disagree with the users saying that she ’ s a bitch , we don ’ t know enough about her to judge that fact . I do , however , agree with those who said you ’ re not an asshole . While your actions may have made some women uncomfortable , the fact that you ’ ve realised that and feel bad about it means you ’ re gonna improve on it ; everyone needs feedback and you happened to get some that made you feel bad about your actions . While the ‘ feedback ’ was admittedly very rude and passive aggressive , the real fact of the matter is that you feel bad . Disgusting people don ’ t feel like this when they do disgusting things , good people do . Everyone has moments where they realise they were in the wrong without knowing , and it hurts but it ’ s helpful in the long run . I know this has been quite a misshaped argument on my part , it ’ s 4am for me and I ’ m a bit shitfaced but my final point is : it ’ s not that big of a deal . You can push through this and come out of it a better person in this respect , but it ’ s still a situation that would ( as a woman who ’ s been on the receiving end of such messages ) leave very little impact on the people you messaged ’ s lives .

       "      <td>Fuck I feel you - I had such bad anger when I was depressed . No it ’ s not right that you yell at him but don ’ t blame yourself and don ’ t blame him - It is a symptom of depression and he needs to be understanding of what puts you over the edge and you either need to work together or break up . I ’ m sorry you ’ re both dealing with this . Yes , my boyfriend is amazing and helps calm me down during my anxiety attacks and has just held me while I cried and sometimes I used to get mad at him and try to push him away and he was really great about it . I ’ m now way way better because I ’ ve finally found a medication that works for me ( which I feel so lucky cuz I ’ ve had horrible luck with medication in the past and went almost ten years without taking any ) I ’ ve had boyfriends in the past who were not supportive and / or were the * cause * of my depression . I ’ m not trying to say that you have to wait until you ’ re not depressed to date , but sometimes working on yourself and seeing how you feel without another influence in your life can be really helpful . It helped me a lot . #definitely don ’ t be afraid to tell people HOW you need help ! Your boyfriend may be clueless on how to properly help you - idk how young you guys are . What your financial situation is , or how long you have been together , but if you ’ re young and he wants to go out and be social and you ’ re unable to , he may be resentful . Or if he ’ s paying your bills while you lay in bed depressed I ’ m sure that ’ s really frustrating for him . It usually goes two ways , and you have to understand that you probably aren ’ t acting your best self . Not to say you should blame yourself or be angry at yourself - but that you do need to put in the extra work to make yourself a priority . Get therapy , find support groups , read articles online , start medication if that ’ s something you ’ re interested in ( don ’ t feel like you have to ) , try reading , yoga , walks , taking a bath , or working out . Some days when I was depressed the most I could do was just take a shower or brush my teeth and go back to bed . But the more you try to build a routine no matter how small or maybe even pointless , you ’ re still taking steps in the right direction . Tell him what you need , let him know that you ’ re needing space , needing him to hold you , needing him to play a video game with you , needing him to take you out on a date so you have a reason to get dressed up - literally give him things he can do to help you and ask what you can do in return ( like go on a hangout with him and his friends , go out bowling together , take a walk to the park , do a chore around the house for him ) and see if any of that helps you both soften up a bit and see that the other is trying . Idk I know I just rambled a lot but I feel for you because I have been there .</td>\n",

It's like that popular tiktok sound \" Raining ? Why is it still raining ? I did everything I was supposed to . \" Well unfortunately it feels like that rain will never go away . I've tried explaining it to him , but in the end I just let him do what he does best . Men like to fix things so if it looks like I'm happy with what he is doing , he keeps doing it . I see that as supportive enough . It does make me happy even if this heavy cloud never leaves .</td>\n",

       "1  Fuck I feel you - I had such bad anger when I was depressed . No it ’ s not right that you yell at him but don ’ t blame yourself and don ’ t blame him - It is a symptom of depression and he needs to be understanding of what puts you over the edge and you either need to work together or break up . I ’ m sorry you ’ re both dealing with this . Yes , my boyfriend is amazing and helps calm me down during my anxiety attacks and has just held me while I cried and sometimes I used to get mad at him and try to push him away and he was really great about it . I ’ m now way way better because I ’ ve finally found a medication that works for me ( which I feel so lucky cuz I ’ ve had horrible luck with medication in the past and went almost ten years without taking any ) I ’ ve had boyfriends in the past who were not supportive and / or were the * cause * of my depression . I ’ m not trying to say that you have to wait until you ’ re not depressed to date , but sometimes working on yourself and seeing how you feel without another influence in your life can be really helpful . It helped me a lot . #definitely don ’ t be afraid to tell people HOW you need help ! Your boyfriend may be clueless on how to properly help you - idk how young you guys are . What your financial situation is , or how long you have been together , but if you ’ re young and he wants to go out and be social and you ’ re unable to , he may be resentful . Or if he ’ s paying your bills while you lay in bed depressed I ’ m sure that ’ s really frustrating for him . It usually goes two ways , and you have to understand that you probably aren ’ t acting your best self . Not to say you should blame yourself or be angry at yourself - but that you do need to put in the extra work to make yourself a priority . Get therapy , find support groups , read articles online , start medication if that ’ s something you ’ re interested in ( don ’ t feel like you have to ) , try reading , yoga , walks , taking a bath , or working out . Some days when I was depressed the most I could do was just take a shower or brush my teeth and go back to bed . But the more you try to build a routine no matter how small or maybe even pointless , you ’ re still taking steps in the right direction . Tell him what you need , let him know that you ’ re needing space , needing him to hold you , needing him to play a video game with you , needing him to take you out on a date so you have a reason to get dressed up - literally give him things he can do to help you and ask what you can do in return ( like go on a hangout with him and his friends , go out bowling together , take a walk to the park , do a chore around the house for him ) and see if any of that helps you both soften up a bit and see that the other is trying .

It's like that popular tiktok sound \" Raining ? Why is it still raining ? I did everything I was supposed to . \" Well unfortunately it feels like that rain will never go away . I've tried explaining it to him , but in the end I just let him do what he does best . Men like to fix things so if it looks like I'm happy with what he is doing , he keeps doing it .

       "      <td>Fuck I feel you - I had such bad anger when I was depressed . No it ’ s not right that you yell at him but don ’ t blame yourself and don ’ t blame him - It is a symptom of depression and he needs to be understanding of what puts you over the edge and you either need to work together or break up . I ’ m sorry you ’ re both dealing with this . Yes , my boyfriend is amazing and helps calm me down during my anxiety attacks and has just held me while I cried and sometimes I used to get mad at him and try to push him away and he was really great about it . I ’ m now way way better because I ’ ve finally found a medication that works for me ( which I feel so lucky cuz I ’ ve had horrible luck with medication in the past and went almost ten years without taking any ) I ’ ve had boyfriends in the past who were not supportive and / or were the * cause * of my depression . I ’ m not trying to say that you have to wait until you ’ re not depressed to date , but sometimes working on yourself and seeing how you feel without another influence in your life can be really helpful . It helped me a lot . #definitely don ’ t be afraid to tell people HOW you need help ! Your boyfriend may be clueless on how to properly help you - idk how young you guys are . What your financial situation is , or how long you have been together , but if you ’ re young and he wants to go out and be social and you ’ re unable to , he may be resentful . Or if he ’ s paying your bills while you lay in bed depressed I ’ m sure that ’ s really frustrating for him . It usually goes two ways , and you have to understand that you probably aren ’ t acting your best self . Not to say you should blame yourself or be angry at yourself - but that you do need to put in the extra work to make yourself a priority . Get therapy , find support groups , read articles online , start medication if that ’ s something you ’ re interested in ( don ’ t feel like you have to ) , try reading , yoga , walks , taking a bath , or working out . Some days when I was depressed the most I could do was just take a shower or brush my teeth and go back to bed . But the more you try to build a routine no matter how small or maybe even pointless , you ’ re still taking steps in the right direction . Tell him what you need , let him know that you ’ re needing space , needing him to hold you , needing him to play a video game with you , needing him to take you out on a date so you have a reason to get dressed up - literally give him things he can do to help you and ask what you can do in return ( like go on a hangout with him and his friends , go out bowling together , take a walk to the park , do a chore around the house for him ) and see if any of that helps you both soften up a bit and see that the other is trying . Idk I know I just rambled a lot but I feel for you because I have been there .</td>\n",

       "1  Fuck I feel you - I had such bad anger when I was depressed . No it ’ s not right that you yell at him but don ’ t blame yourself and don ’ t blame him - It is a symptom of depression and he needs to be understanding of what puts you over the edge and you either need to work together or break up . I ’ m sorry you ’ re both dealing with this . Yes , my boyfriend is amazing and helps calm me down during my anxiety attacks and has just held me while I cried and sometimes I used to get mad at him and try to push him away and he was really great about it . I ’ m now way way better because I ’ ve finally found a medication that works for me ( which I feel so lucky cuz I ’ ve had horrible luck with medication in the past and went almost ten years without taking any ) I ’ ve had boyfriends in the past who were not supportive and / or were the * cause * of my depression . I ’ m not trying to say that you have to wait until you ’ re not depressed to date , but sometimes working on yourself and seeing how you feel without another influence in your life can be really helpful . It helped me a lot . #definitely don ’ t be afraid to tell people HOW you need help ! Your boyfriend may be clueless on how to properly help you - idk how young you guys are . What your financial situation is , or how long you have been together , but if you ’ re young and he wants to go out and be social and you ’ re unable to , he may be resentful . Or if he ’ s paying your bills while you lay in bed depressed I ’ m sure that ’ s really frustrating for him . It usually goes two ways , and you have to understand that you probably aren ’ t acting your best self . Not to say you should blame yourself or be angry at yourself - but that you do need to put in the extra work to make yourself a priority . Get therapy , find support groups , read articles online , start medication if that ’ s something you ’ re interested in ( don ’ t feel like you have to ) , try reading , yoga , walks , taking a bath , or working out . Some days when I was depressed the most I could do was just take a shower or brush my teeth and go back to bed . But the more you try to build a routine no matter how small or maybe even pointless , you ’ re still taking steps in the right direction . Tell him what you need , let him know that you ’ re needing space , needing him to hold you , needing him to play a video game with you , needing him to take you out on a date so you have a reason to get dressed up - literally give him things he can do to help you and ask what you can do in return ( like go on a hangout with him and his friends , go out bowling together , take a walk to the park , do a chore around the house for him ) and see if any of that helps you both soften up a bit and see that the other is trying .

It's like that popular tiktok sound \" Raining ? Why is it still raining ? I did everything I was supposed to . \" Well unfortunately it feels like that rain will never go away . I've tried explaining it to him , but in the end I just let him do what he does best . Men like to fix things so if it looks like I'm happy with what he is doing , he keeps doing it .

       "      <td>I disagree with the users saying that she ’ s a bitch , we don ’ t know enough about her to judge that fact . I do , however , agree with those who said you ’ re not an asshole . While your actions may have made some women uncomfortable , the fact that you ’ ve realised that and feel bad about it means you ’ re gonna improve on it ; everyone needs feedback and you happened to get some that made you feel bad about your actions . While the ‘ feedback ’ was admittedly very rude and passive aggressive , the real fact of the matter is that you feel bad . Disgusting people don ’ t feel like this when they do disgusting things , good people do . Everyone has moments where they realise they were in the wrong without knowing , and it hurts but it ’ s helpful in the long run . I know this has been quite a misshaped argument on my part , it ’ s 4am for me and I ’ m a bit shitfaced but my final point is : it ’ s not that big of a deal . You can push through this and come out of it a better person in this respect , but it ’ s still a situation that would ( as a woman who ’ s been on the receiving end of such messages ) leave very little impact on the people you messaged ’ s lives . Dude I ’ m sorry for this it ’ s horrible and mortifying but honestly situations like this feel like shit for a bit .</td>\n",

       "429  I disagree with the users saying that she ’ s a bitch , we don ’ t know enough about her to judge that fact . I do , however , agree with those who said you ’ re not an asshole . While your actions may have made some women uncomfortable , the fact that you ’ ve realised that and feel bad about it means you ’ re gonna improve on it ; everyone needs feedback and you happened to get some that made you feel bad about your actions . While the ‘ feedback ’ was admittedly very rude and passive aggressive , the real fact of the matter is that you feel bad . Disgusting people don ’ t feel like this when they do disgusting things , good people do . Everyone has moments where they realise they were in the wrong without knowing , and it hurts but it ’ s helpful in the long run . I know this has been quite a misshaped argument on my part , it ’ s 4am for me and I ’ m a bit shitfaced but my final point is : it ’ s not that big of a deal . You can push through this and come out of it a better person in this respect , but it ’ s still a situation that would ( as a woman who ’ s been on the receiving end of such messages ) leave very little impact on the people you messaged ’ s lives .
