       "      <td>Fuck I feel you - I had such bad anger when I was depressed . No it ’ s not right that you yell at him but don ’ t blame yourself and don ’ t blame him - It is a symptom of depression and he needs to be understanding of what puts you over the edge and you either need to work together or break up . I ’ m sorry you ’ re both dealing with this . Yes , my boyfriend is amazing and helps calm me down during my anxiety attacks and has just held me while I cried and sometimes I used to get mad at him and try to push him away and he was really great about it . I ’ m now way way better because I ’ ve finally found a medication that works for me ( which I feel so lucky cuz I ’ ve had horrible luck with medication in the past and went almost ten years without taking any ) I ’ ve had boyfriends in the past who were not supportive and / or were the * cause * of my depression . I ’ m not trying to say that you have to wait until you ’ re not depressed to date , but sometimes working on yourself and seeing how you feel without another influence in your life can be really helpful . It helped me a lot . #definitely don ’ t be afraid to tell people HOW you need help ! Your boyfriend may be clueless on how to properly help you - idk how young you guys are . What your financial situation is , or how long you have been together , but if you ’ re young and he wants to go out and be social and you ’ re unable to , he may be resentful . Or if he ’ s paying your bills while you lay in bed depressed I ’ m sure that ’ s really frustrating for him . It usually goes two ways , and you have to understand that you probably aren ’ t acting your best self . Not to say you should blame yourself or be angry at yourself - but that you do need to put in the extra work to make yourself a priority . Get therapy , find support groups , read articles online , start medication if that ’ s something you ’ re interested in ( don ’ t feel like you have to ) , try reading , yoga , walks , taking a bath , or working out . Some days when I was depressed the most I could do was just take a shower or brush my teeth and go back to bed . But the more you try to build a routine no matter how small or maybe even pointless , you ’ re still taking steps in the right direction . Tell him what you need , let him know that you ’ re needing space , needing him to hold you , needing him to play a video game with you , needing him to take you out on a date so you have a reason to get dressed up - literally give him things he can do to help you and ask what you can do in return ( like go on a hangout with him and his friends , go out bowling together , take a walk to the park , do a chore around the house for him ) and see if any of that helps you both soften up a bit and see that the other is trying . Idk I know I just rambled a lot but I feel for you because I have been there .</td>\n",

I've tried explaining it to him , but in the end I just let him do what he does best . Men like to fix things so if it looks like I'm happy with what he is doing , he keeps doing it .

       "1  Fuck I feel you - I had such bad anger when I was depressed . No it ’ s not right that you yell at him but don ’ t blame yourself and don ’ t blame him - It is a symptom of depression and he needs to be understanding of what puts you over the edge and you either need to work together or break up . I ’ m sorry you ’ re both dealing with this . Yes , my boyfriend is amazing and helps calm me down during my anxiety attacks and has just held me while I cried and sometimes I used to get mad at him and try to push him away and he was really great about it . I ’ m now way way better because I ’ ve finally found a medication that works for me ( which I feel so lucky cuz I ’ ve had horrible luck with medication in the past and went almost ten years without taking any ) I ’ ve had boyfriends in the past who were not supportive and / or were the * cause * of my depression . I ’ m not trying to say that you have to wait until you ’ re not depressed to date , but sometimes working on yourself and seeing how you feel without another influence in your life can be really helpful . It helped me a lot . #definitely don ’ t be afraid to tell people HOW you need help ! Your boyfriend may be clueless on how to properly help you - idk how young you guys are . What your financial situation is , or how long you have been together , but if you ’ re young and he wants to go out and be social and you ’ re unable to , he may be resentful . Or if he ’ s paying your bills while you lay in bed depressed I ’ m sure that ’ s really frustrating for him . It usually goes two ways , and you have to understand that you probably aren ’ t acting your best self . Not to say you should blame yourself or be angry at yourself - but that you do need to put in the extra work to make yourself a priority . Get therapy , find support groups , read articles online , start medication if that ’ s something you ’ re interested in ( don ’ t feel like you have to ) , try reading , yoga , walks , taking a bath , or working out . Some days when I was depressed the most I could do was just take a shower or brush my teeth and go back to bed . But the more you try to build a routine no matter how small or maybe even pointless , you ’ re still taking steps in the right direction . Tell him what you need , let him know that you ’ re needing space , needing him to hold you , needing him to play a video game with you , needing him to take you out on a date so you have a reason to get dressed up - literally give him things he can do to help you and ask what you can do in return ( like go on a hangout with him and his friends , go out bowling together , take a walk to the park , do a chore around the house for him ) and see if any of that helps you both soften up a bit and see that the other is trying .

It's like that popular tiktok sound \" Raining ? Why is it still raining ? I did everything I was supposed to . \" Well unfortunately it feels like that rain will never go away . I've tried explaining it to him , but in the end I just let him do what he does best . Men like to fix things so if it looks like I'm happy with what he is doing , he keeps doing it .

       "      <td>Fuck I feel you - I had such bad anger when I was depressed . No it ’ s not right that you yell at him but don ’ t blame yourself and don ’ t blame him - It is a symptom of depression and he needs to be understanding of what puts you over the edge and you either need to work together or break up . I ’ m sorry you ’ re both dealing with this . Yes , my boyfriend is amazing and helps calm me down during my anxiety attacks and has just held me while I cried and sometimes I used to get mad at him and try to push him away and he was really great about it . I ’ m now way way better because I ’ ve finally found a medication that works for me ( which I feel so lucky cuz I ’ ve had horrible luck with medication in the past and went almost ten years without taking any ) I ’ ve had boyfriends in the past who were not supportive and / or were the * cause * of my depression . I ’ m not trying to say that you have to wait until you ’ re not depressed to date , but sometimes working on yourself and seeing how you feel without another influence in your life can be really helpful . It helped me a lot . #definitely don ’ t be afraid to tell people HOW you need help ! Your boyfriend may be clueless on how to properly help you - idk how young you guys are . What your financial situation is , or how long you have been together , but if you ’ re young and he wants to go out and be social and you ’ re unable to , he may be resentful . Or if he ’ s paying your bills while you lay in bed depressed I ’ m sure that ’ s really frustrating for him . It usually goes two ways , and you have to understand that you probably aren ’ t acting your best self . Not to say you should blame yourself or be angry at yourself - but that you do need to put in the extra work to make yourself a priority . Get therapy , find support groups , read articles online , start medication if that ’ s something you ’ re interested in ( don ’ t feel like you have to ) , try reading , yoga , walks , taking a bath , or working out . Some days when I was depressed the most I could do was just take a shower or brush my teeth and go back to bed . But the more you try to build a routine no matter how small or maybe even pointless , you ’ re still taking steps in the right direction . Tell him what you need , let him know that you ’ re needing space , needing him to hold you , needing him to play a video game with you , needing him to take you out on a date so you have a reason to get dressed up - literally give him things he can do to help you and ask what you can do in return ( like go on a hangout with him and his friends , go out bowling together , take a walk to the park , do a chore around the house for him ) and see if any of that helps you both soften up a bit and see that the other is trying . Idk I know I just rambled a lot but I feel for you because I have been there .</td>\n",

       "1  Fuck I feel you - I had such bad anger when I was depressed . No it ’ s not right that you yell at him but don ’ t blame yourself and don ’ t blame him - It is a symptom of depression and he needs to be understanding of what puts you over the edge and you either need to work together or break up . I ’ m sorry you ’ re both dealing with this . Yes , my boyfriend is amazing and helps calm me down during my anxiety attacks and has just held me while I cried and sometimes I used to get mad at him and try to push him away and he was really great about it . I ’ m now way way better because I ’ ve finally found a medication that works for me ( which I feel so lucky cuz I ’ ve had horrible luck with medication in the past and went almost ten years without taking any ) I ’ ve had boyfriends in the past who were not supportive and / or were the * cause * of my depression . I ’ m not trying to say that you have to wait until you ’ re not depressed to date , but sometimes working on yourself and seeing how you feel without another influence in your life can be really helpful . It helped me a lot . #definitely don ’ t be afraid to tell people HOW you need help ! Your boyfriend may be clueless on how to properly help you - idk how young you guys are . What your financial situation is , or how long you have been together , but if you ’ re young and he wants to go out and be social and you ’ re unable to , he may be resentful . Or if he ’ s paying your bills while you lay in bed depressed I ’ m sure that ’ s really frustrating for him . It usually goes two ways , and you have to understand that you probably aren ’ t acting your best self . Not to say you should blame yourself or be angry at yourself - but that you do need to put in the extra work to make yourself a priority . Get therapy , find support groups , read articles online , start medication if that ’ s something you ’ re interested in ( don ’ t feel like you have to ) , try reading , yoga , walks , taking a bath , or working out . Some days when I was depressed the most I could do was just take a shower or brush my teeth and go back to bed . But the more you try to build a routine no matter how small or maybe even pointless , you ’ re still taking steps in the right direction . Tell him what you need , let him know that you ’ re needing space , needing him to hold you , needing him to play a video game with you , needing him to take you out on a date so you have a reason to get dressed up - literally give him things he can do to help you and ask what you can do in return ( like go on a hangout with him and his friends , go out bowling together , take a walk to the park , do a chore around the house for him ) and see if any of that helps you both soften up a bit and see that the other is trying . Idk I know I just rambled a lot but I feel for you because I have been there .        neutral              negative      joy                 5        0     0      0    0        0         0        0    0\n",

It's like that popular tiktok sound \" Raining ? Why is it still raining ? I did everything I was supposed to . \" Well unfortunately it feels like that rain will never go away . I've tried explaining it to him , but in the end I just let him do what he does best . Men like to fix things so if it looks like I'm happy with what he is doing , he keeps doing it .

I tend to bottle things up to avoid confrontation . I wonder why that is ? Also , I feel like i always have to push myself to be social . ( after all this pandemic thing ) I get a feeling of regret as soon as I make plans with my girls . - thinking i rather should have stayed home with my little one .

       "      <td>Fuck I feel you - I had such bad anger when I was depressed . No it ’ s not right that you yell at him but don ’ t blame yourself and don ’ t blame him - It is a symptom of depression and he needs to be understanding of what puts you over the edge and you either need to work together or break up . I ’ m sorry you ’ re both dealing with this . Yes , my boyfriend is amazing and helps calm me down during my anxiety attacks and has just held me while I cried and sometimes I used to get mad at him and try to push him away and he was really great about it . I ’ m now way way better because I ’ ve finally found a medication that works for me ( which I feel so lucky cuz I ’ ve had horrible luck with medication in the past and went almost ten years without taking any ) I ’ ve had boyfriends in the past who were not supportive and / or were the * cause * of my depression . I ’ m not trying to say that you have to wait until you ’ re not depressed to date , but sometimes working on yourself and seeing how you feel without another influence in your life can be really helpful . It helped me a lot . #definitely don ’ t be afraid to tell people HOW you need help ! Your boyfriend may be clueless on how to properly help you - idk how young you guys are . What your financial situation is , or how long you have been together , but if you ’ re young and he wants to go out and be social and you ’ re unable to , he may be resentful . Or if he ’ s paying your bills while you lay in bed depressed I ’ m sure that ’ s really frustrating for him . It usually goes two ways , and you have to understand that you probably aren ’ t acting your best self . Not to say you should blame yourself or be angry at yourself - but that you do need to put in the extra work to make yourself a priority . Get therapy , find support groups , read articles online , start medication if that ’ s something you ’ re interested in ( don ’ t feel like you have to ) , try reading , yoga , walks , taking a bath , or working out . Some days when I was depressed the most I could do was just take a shower or brush my teeth and go back to bed . But the more you try to build a routine no matter how small or maybe even pointless , you ’ re still taking steps in the right direction . Tell him what you need , let him know that you ’ re needing space , needing him to hold you , needing him to play a video game with you , needing him to take you out on a date so you have a reason to get dressed up - literally give him things he can do to help you and ask what you can do in return ( like go on a hangout with him and his friends , go out bowling together , take a walk to the park , do a chore around the house for him ) and see if any of that helps you both soften up a bit and see that the other is trying . Idk I know I just rambled a lot but I feel for you because I have been there .</td>\n",

It's like that popular tiktok sound \" Raining ? Why is it still raining ? I did everything I was supposed to . \" Well unfortunately it feels like that rain will never go away . I've tried explaining it to him , but in the end I just let him do what he does best . Men like to fix things so if it looks like I'm happy with what he is doing , he keeps doing it . I see that as supportive enough . It does make me happy even if this heavy cloud never leaves .</td>\n",

       "1    Fuck I feel you - I had such bad anger when I was depressed . No it ’ s not right that you yell at him but don ’ t blame yourself and don ’ t blame him - It is a symptom of depression and he needs to be understanding of what puts you over the edge and you either need to work together or break up . I ’ m sorry you ’ re both dealing with this . Yes , my boyfriend is amazing and helps calm me down during my anxiety attacks and has just held me while I cried and sometimes I used to get mad at him and try to push him away and he was really great about it . I ’ m now way way better because I ’ ve finally found a medication that works for me ( which I feel so lucky cuz I ’ ve had horrible luck with medication in the past and went almost ten years without taking any ) I ’ ve had boyfriends in the past who were not supportive and / or were the * cause * of my depression . I ’ m not trying to say that you have to wait until you ’ re not depressed to date , but sometimes working on yourself and seeing how you feel without another influence in your life can be really helpful . It helped me a lot . #definitely don ’ t be afraid to tell people HOW you need help ! Your boyfriend may be clueless on how to properly help you - idk how young you guys are . What your financial situation is , or how long you have been together , but if you ’ re young and he wants to go out and be social and you ’ re unable to , he may be resentful . Or if he ’ s paying your bills while you lay in bed depressed I ’ m sure that ’ s really frustrating for him . It usually goes two ways , and you have to understand that you probably aren ’ t acting your best self . Not to say you should blame yourself or be angry at yourself - but that you do need to put in the extra work to make yourself a priority . Get therapy , find support groups , read articles online , start medication if that ’ s something you ’ re interested in ( don ’ t feel like you have to ) , try reading , yoga , walks , taking a bath , or working out . Some days when I was depressed the most I could do was just take a shower or brush my teeth and go back to bed . But the more you try to build a routine no matter how small or maybe even pointless , you ’ re still taking steps in the right direction . Tell him what you need , let him know that you ’ re needing space , needing him to hold you , needing him to play a video game with you , needing him to take you out on a date so you have a reason to get dressed up - literally give him things he can do to help you and ask what you can do in return ( like go on a hangout with him and his friends , go out bowling together , take a walk to the park , do a chore around the house for him ) and see if any of that helps you both soften up a bit and see that the other is trying . Idk I know I just rambled a lot but I feel for you because I have been there .        neutral              negative      joy                 5        0     0      0    0        0         0        0    0\n",

It's like that popular tiktok sound \" Raining ? Why is it still raining ? I did everything I was supposed to . \" Well unfortunately it feels like that rain will never go away . I've tried explaining it to him , but in the end I just let him do what he does best . Men like to fix things so if it looks like I'm happy with what he is doing , he keeps doing it . I see that as supportive enough . It does make me happy even if this heavy cloud never leaves .       positive              negative      joy                 7        0     0      0    1        0         0        0    1\n",

Twenty years ago I was just like you , unable imagine growing older and being a proper adult . I always had this idea that I would just die young for whatever reason . But it didn ’ t work out like that . Getting older is actually pretty cool and as you get older and you lose people you start to realise your lucky to be here , because those people you lost are gone forever . I do like your idea of reincarnation , a lot of people in my family believe that . But don ’ t kill yourself just to be reincarnated , you might actually enjoy becoming an adult .        neutral              positive      joy                 5        0     0      0    0        0         0        0    0\n",

       "      <td>It's like slow suicide isn't it . 2020 I had two very deliberate attempts , I saw what they did to my family , hoe much distress it caused . Last year I just ate and drank silly amounts of stuff , like I'd sit and eat a full pack of parmesan cheese or huge bars of chocolate - knowing it wasn't good for me , knowing that at my age it could easily put me into heart attack zone ... it would look like a heart attack when in fact I'd sabotaged my health so badly it was a slow suicide . I also danced way to close to fatal doses of codeine etc but it would have appeared as an accidental overdose ... I'm all aches and pains and discomfort because of that now , because of the amount of codeine I've taken , because of all the shit I've put in my body . I've a wife and kids , the three eldest are adult enough to know I've struggled and thar it's not them , it's me , but I can't put that on my 6 year old ... I can not have her have such a horrible thing happen and then qs she gets older realise what I've done . I'm left so damaged by the fact that my blood family , my parents and sister just treat me as something to toy with , tried to manipulate my emotions etc , took chances on my mental health and security and exploited my vulnerabilities . I'm not sure why my parents , moreso my mother , would do that ? Whats important for me is that the kids know that it's not them causing the issues , it's my childhood and emotional abuse from people I'm supposed to have trusted , causing me the issues . I've been left to deal with the fallout from my mothers mental health issues , that she refuses to recognise , but I've recognised mine and I'm determined to not have the next generation to handle mine . My 6 year old especially doesn't deserve to have her life ripped apart like that , so I'm working hard to undo all the damage I've done to myself and change the environment around me to make it easier to have headspace I live in such a cluttered , overcrowded house that my mind will never be tidy until the house is , so that's one of the big things this year . I've identified all my triggers now I think , whereas I wasn't able to through the fog of medication etc , so now I'm free of all thar it's time to work on each trigger and change it . Not easy , there will be bumps in the road but for the first time in ages It feels progressive , I'm just taking baby steps instead of massive leaps like I have in the past</td>\n",

       "238  It's like slow suicide isn't it . 2020 I had two very deliberate attempts , I saw what they did to my family , hoe much distress it caused . Last year I just ate and drank silly amounts of stuff , like I'd sit and eat a full pack of parmesan cheese or huge bars of chocolate - knowing it wasn't good for me , knowing that at my age it could easily put me into heart attack zone ... it would look like a heart attack when in fact I'd sabotaged my health so badly it was a slow suicide . I also danced way to close to fatal doses of codeine etc but it would have appeared as an accidental overdose ... I'm all aches and pains and discomfort because of that now , because of the amount of codeine I've taken , because of all the shit I've put in my body . I've a wife and kids , the three eldest are adult enough to know I've struggled and thar it's not them , it's me , but I can't put that on my 6 year old ... I can not have her have such a horrible thing happen and then qs she gets older realise what I've done . I'm left so damaged by the fact that my blood family , my parents and sister just treat me as something to toy with , tried to manipulate my emotions etc , took chances on my mental health and security and exploited my vulnerabilities . I'm not sure why my parents , moreso my mother , would do that ? Whats important for me is that the kids know that it's not them causing the issues , it's my childhood and emotional abuse from people I'm supposed to have trusted , causing me the issues . I've been left to deal with the fallout from my mothers mental health issues , that she refuses to recognise , but I've recognised mine and I'm determined to not have the next generation to handle mine . My 6 year old especially doesn't deserve to have her life ripped apart like that , so I'm working hard to undo all the damage I've done to myself and change the environment around me to make it easier to have headspace I live in such a cluttered , overcrowded house that my mind will never be tidy until the house is , so that's one of the big things this year . I've identified all my triggers now I think , whereas I wasn't able to through the fog of medication etc , so now I'm free of all thar it's time to work on each trigger and change it . Not easy , there will be bumps in the road but for the first time in ages It feels progressive , I'm just taking baby steps instead of massive leaps like I have in the past        neutral              negative      joy                 5        1     0      0    0        1         0        0    2\n",

And , there's a much easier way to have guys stop hitting on you . 1 . You can block them . They'll never know . 2 . You can tell them to fuck off . If they don't get the message , refer back to step 1 . And if they continue to harass , you get a restraining order .        neutral              positive    anger                 5        1     0      1    0        0         0        0    2\n",

I do , however , agree with those who said you ’ re not an asshole . While your actions may have made some women uncomfortable , the fact that you ’ ve realised that and feel bad about it means you ’ re gonna improve on it ; everyone needs feedback and you happened to get some that made you feel bad about your actions . While the ‘ feedback ’ was admittedly very rude and passive aggressive , the real fact of the matter is that you feel bad . Disgusting people don ’ t feel like this when they do disgusting things , good people do . Everyone has moments where they realise they were in the wrong without knowing , and it hurts but it ’ s helpful in the long run . I know this has been quite a misshaped argument on my part , it ’ s 4am for me and I ’ m a bit shitfaced but my final point is : it ’ s not that big of a deal . You can push through this and come out of it a better person in this respect , but it ’ s still a situation that would ( as a woman who ’ s been on the receiving end of such messages ) leave very little impact on the people you messaged ’ s lives .
