    "As a conclusion, I would say that my model is sufficiently good since it can correctly classify 76% of the posts, which means almost 80% of lost data can be restored accurately. Although I'm rather contented with the performance of my SVC model, I do wonder if implementing a trigram or beyond approach would help me reduce the number of wrong predictions. Having said that, I did run GridSearch which picked out the best ngram_range as \\[1,2\\] instead of \\[1,3\\] so I shan't pick on it.\n",

    "Considering the accuracy score improved from 0.6+ to 0.7+ by me scrapping an extra 1000 posts per subreddit, I do think my model can do even better if I scrapped more posts. However, with limited time and processing power, the engineer in question should be happy to implement this model in sorting out the posts. On another note, I do believe that if I had more columns of data besides just the title text, my model's performance may be enhanced even further. In the long run, machine learning models are in fact very much feasible for automated moderation in a bit to lighten the human moderator's workload. Having said that, I must also state a caveat that no matter what model we have, such a classification is still somewhat of a blackbox because we cannot say for certain that specific words determine the source of the subreddit since it really depends on the context of the word use. \n"
